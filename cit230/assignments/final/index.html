        <h2><b>Cross country </b></h2>
        <p>Cross country (XC) mountain bikes are designed primarily around the discipline of cross country racing, placing emphasis on climbing speed and endurance, and therefore demanding lightweight, efficient bikes.
          The geometry of Cross Country bikes favours climbing ability and fast responses over descending and stability, and as a result typical head angles are 70–71°. Although intended for off-road use, Cross Country bikes are not designed for use on steep or particularly rough terrain. Put in terms of rider emphasis, XC bikes are designed for approximately 80% uphill or flat riding, and 20% downhill.

        <h2><b>"Trail" Bikes</b></h2>
        <p>"Trail" Bikes are a development of XC bikes that are generally used by recreational mountain bikers either at purpose built "trail centers" or on natural off-road trails.  With less of an emphasis on weight, Trail Bikes are typically built to handle rougher terrain than dedicated XC bikes while having slacker head angles (69-68°) which provides greater stability while descending. Trail bikes are designed for approximately 60-70% uphill, and 30-40% downhill riding.

        <h2><b>Downhill </b></h2>
        <p>An upgraded Downhill/Freeride bike: Specialized Bighit 2006 with 203 millimetres (8.0 in) of travel in the front and 190 millimetres (7.5 in) of travel in the back.
            Downhill (DH) bikes typically have eight or more inches (200 mm) of suspension travel, and extremely low, slack geometry intended to set the rider in a comfortable position when descending steep trails at high speed. Due to their often high gear ratios, soft suspension, and aggressive geometry, Downhill bikes are ideal only for riding down dedicated trails or race courses, almost universally requiring the bike to be carried uphill rather than ridden. Downhill frames are often intended for racing, and as such are required to be both extremely durable and lightweight.
